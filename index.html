    <!-- Section 1 Description -->
    <section class="easy">
      <h3>Section 1: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
      <p>This section introduces the implementation of data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently, as well as their associated algorithms with the aim of developing problem solving skills. It also includes important software development concepts of decomposition and modularity, as well as techniques such as the use of decision tables to test if algorithms work as intended. Students will need to abstract both data and procedures when they apply computational thinking to a problem. Students will also learn to implement various search and sort algorithms, and compare their efficiencies for evaluation purposes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 Description -->
    <section class="easy">
      <h3>Section 2: Programming</h3>
      <p>This section introduces students to the fundamental principles of programming in scripting languages. Students will learn about the common standards of programming style, programming constructs and library functions to be able to develop their own programs to solve a variety of problems. They are also required to write code to implement data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists and binary search trees. In addition, students will be expected to design, test and debug their own programs to ensure that they can work through lab-based practical assignments. The fundamental concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism associated with object-oriented programming are also covered in this section.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 Description -->
    <section class="not-easy">
      <h3>Section 3: Data and Information</h3>
      <p>This section introduces students to the design, use and application of database management systems. The topics include relational data model, relational query languages and conceptual data design and modelling for relational database design. Students are expected to write programs to retrieve data from either a relational or non-relational database, process the data and return the processed data as a result. The use of databases also highlights the importance of data privacy and integrity. Students should be able to describe measures to safeguard the use of data. In addition, students should be able to describe the code of conduct of a computing professional and discuss the social, economic and ethical implications of computing and technology.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 Description -->
    <section class="not-easy">
      <h3>Section 4: Computer Networks</h3>
      <p>This section provides a broad view of the different types of basic networks, communication protocols and standards in a network. Students will be expected to understand concepts and techniques for developing web applications, describe the different types of threats to network security and propose mechanisms to protect and secure access to networks. They need to design, develop and test web applications as a consolidation of knowledge and skills through hands-on practical work and projects.
